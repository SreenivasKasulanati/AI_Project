**Overview**

The Heart Stroke Predicꢀon System is an arꢀﬁcial intelligence and machine learning-based

•

project designed to predict the likelihood of a person experiencing a heart stroke. This system

uꢀlizes advanced algorithms to analyse relevant medical data and provide a predicꢀve model

for assessing the risk of a heart stroke.

**Features**

•

•

Predicts the likelihood of a heart stroke based on input data.

Uses machine learning and arꢀﬁcial intelligence algorithms

1\. Logisꢀc regression

2\. Decision tree

3\. Random Forest

4\. XG-Boost classiﬁer

5\. Hybrid-voꢀng classiﬁer

•

Uꢀlized AI components such as BFS (Breadth First Search) as part of data preprocessing for

missing value imputaꢀon.

•

•

Provides a user-friendly interface for inpuꢁng medical data.

Oﬀers quick and accurate predicꢀons for early intervenꢀon.

**Installaꢀon**

•

•

Clone the repository:

1\. git clone= https://github.com/SreenivasKasulanati/AI\_Project

2\. python app.py

•

•

•

Access the applicaꢀon in your web browser at hꢂp://localhost:5000.

Input the required medical data in the provided form.

Click the "Predict" buꢂon to get the heart stroke predicꢀon.

**Dependencies**

•

•

•

•

•

Python 3.7+

Flask

Scikit-learn

Pandas

NumPy

**Data**



<a name="br2"></a> 

•

The system uses a dataset containing relevant medical informaꢀon for training and tesꢀng the

predicꢀve model. The dataset is included in the data directory.
