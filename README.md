**Overview**

The Heart Stroke Predicꢀon System is an arꢀﬁcial intelligence and machine learning-based

project designed to predict the likelihood of a person experiencing a heart stroke. This system

utilizes advanced algorithms to analyse relevant medical data and provide a predicꢀve model

for assessing the risk of a heart stroke.


**Features**


Predicts the likelihood of a heart stroke based on input data.

Utilized AI components such as BFS (Breadth First Search) as part of data preprocessing for

missing value imputation.

Uses machine learning and artiﬁcial intelligence algorithms

1\. Logistic regression

2\. Decision tree

3\. Random Forest

4\. XG-Boost classiﬁer

5\. Hybrid-voꢀng classiﬁer


Provides a user-friendly interface for inpuꢁng medical data.

Oﬀers quick and accurate predicꢀons for early intervenꢀon.


**Installation**

Clone the repository:

1\. git clone= https://github.com/SreenivasKasulanati/AI\_Project

Install the required dependencies:

2\. pip install -r requirements.txt


**Usage**


Navigate to the project directory:

1\. cd heart-stroke-predicꢀon

Run the applicaꢀon:

2\. python app.py

Access the applicaꢀon in your web browser at http://localhost:5000.

Input the required medical data in the provided form.

Click the "Predict" buꢂon to get the heart stroke prediction.


**Dependencies**

Python 3.7+

Flask

Scikit-learn

Pandas

NumPy

**Data**

<a name="br2"></a> 
The system uses a dataset containing relevant medical informaꢀon for training and tesꢀng the

predicꢀve model. The dataset is included in the data directory.
