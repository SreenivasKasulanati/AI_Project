Overview:
The Heart Stroke Prediction System is an artificial intelligence and machine learning-based project designed to predict the likelihood of a person experiencing a heart stroke. This system utilizes advanced algorithms to analyse relevant medical data and provide a predictive model for assessing the risk of a heart stroke.

Features:
Predicts the likelihood of a heart stroke based on input data.
Utilized AI components such as BFS (Breadth First Search) as part of data preprocessing for missing value imputation.
Uses machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms
1.Logistic regression
2.Decision tree
3.Random Forest
4.XG-Boost classifier
5.Hybrid-voting classifier
Provides a user-friendly interface for inputting medical data.
Offers quick and accurate predictions for early intervention.
